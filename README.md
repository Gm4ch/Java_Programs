# Java Programs


This is a library of programs that I have worked on in Java. 
I will be tracking my knowlage of Java by uploading some programs that I work on into this repo. 

1. The first program I have added to this repo is a project called prettyNum. this project takes a number input and asks the user for some formatting guidelines and based on what the user picks, the program rounds the number, adds commas every three numbers, or converts the number to scientific notation.

2. The second program I added to the repo is called Square matrix. this program manilpulates two square matracies based on which class is called. The program also checks to see that every matrix is a square. 

3. the third program is a program called binomial theorem. This program takes an input for n and returns the expanded result of the binomial theorem. while this prpgram has it limitations it works for lower values of N up to 33 where a zero devision error occurs.
